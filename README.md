🏠 London House Price Analysis

End-to-End Data Analytics Project using Python, SQL, and Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes London housing market data to uncover pricing patterns, key value drivers, and location-based trends. It demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow starting from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to database querying and interactive dashboard visualization.

The project showcases practical skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI, making it suitable for academic submission and data analytics portfolios.

🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis aims to answer the following business questions:

What is the overall distribution of property prices in London?

Which London locations have the highest and lowest average property prices?

How do prices vary by house type?

What is the relationship between property size (area) and price?

How does the number of bedrooms impact pricing?

Which properties are the most expensive?

Which areas offer the best value based on price per square foot?

How do prices vary across postal codes?

What factors most strongly influence housing prices?

📈 Key Insights

Property prices vary significantly across London locations.

Property size (area) is one of the strongest predictors of price.

Houses generally command higher prices than flats.

Price per square foot reveals better value areas that are not obvious from total price alone.

Bedrooms and area have a strong positive relationship with price.
